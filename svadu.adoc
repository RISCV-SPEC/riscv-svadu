== Hardware Updating of PTE A/D Bits

The Svadu extension adds support and CSR controls for hardware updating of PTE
A/D bits. The A and D bits are managed by these extensions as follows:

* When a virtual page is accessed and the A bit is clear, the PTE is updated to
  set the A bit.  When the virtual page is written and the D bit is clear, the
  PTE is updated to set the D bit. When G-stage address translation is in use
  and is not Bare, the G-stage virtual pages may be accessed or written by 
  implicit accesses to VS-level memory management data structures, such as page
  tables.

* When two-stage address translation is in use, an explicit access may cause
  one VS-stage PTE to be updated and several G-stage PTEs to be updated. The
  following rules apply to all PTE updates caused by an explicit or an implicit
  memory accesses. +
                                                                               +
  The PTE update must be atomic with respect to other accesses to the PTE, and
  must atomically check that the PTE is valid and grants sufficient permissions.
  Updates of the A bit may be performed as a result of speculation, but updates
  to the D bit must be exact (i.e., not speculative), and observed in program
  order by the local hart. +
                                                                               +
  The PTE update must appear in the global memory order before the memory access
  that caused the PTE update and before any subsequent explicit memory access to
  that virtual page by the local hart. The ordering on loads and stores provided
  by FENCE instructions and the acquire/release bits on atomic instructions also
  orders the PTE updates associated with those loads and stores as observed by
  remote harts. +
                                                                               +
  The PTE update is not required to be atomic with respect to the memory access
  that caused the update and a trap may occur between the PTE update and the 
  memory access that caused the PTE update. If a trap occurs then the A and/or D
  bit may be updated but the memory access that caused the PTE update may not
  occur. The hart must not perform the memory access that caused the PTE update
  before the PTE update is globally visible.

Svadu extension requires the page tables to be located in cacheable main memory
PMA regions.

The translation of virtual addresses (or guest physical addresses) to physical
(or guest physical) addresses is accomplished with the same algorithm as
specified in the Supervisor-Level ISA extension (section 4.3.2) and as modified
by the hypervisor extension (section 8.5.1), except that step 7 of the 
translation process is as follows:

[start=7]
. If `pte.a = 0`, or if the original memory access is a store and `pte.d = 0`:
.. If a store to `pte` would violate a PMA or PMP check, raise an access-fault
   exception corresponding to the original access type.
.. Perform the following steps atomically:
... Compare `pte` to the value of the PTE at address `a + va.vpn[i] Ã— PTESIZE`.
... If the values match, set `pte.a` to 1 and, if the original memory access is
    a store, also set `pte.d` to 1.
... If the comparison fails, return to step 2

The Svadu extension adds the `HADE` bit to `menvcfg`. When `menvcfg.HADE` is 1,
hardware updating of PTE A/D bits is enabled during single-stage address 
translation. When the hypervisor extension is implemented, if `menvcfg.HADE` is 1,
hardware updating of PTE A/D bits is enabled during G-stage address translation.
When `menvcfg.HADE` is zero, the implementation behaves as though Svadu is not
implemented. If Svadu is not implemented, `menvcfg.HADE` is read-only zero.
Furthermore, for implementations with the hypervisor extension, `henvcfg.HADE`
is read-only zero if `menvcfg.HADE` is zero.

When the hypervisor extension is implemented, the Svadu extension adds the
`HADE` bit to `henvcfg`. When `henvcfg.HADE` is 1, hardware updating of PTE A/D
bits is enabled during VS-stage address translation. When `henvcfg.HADE` is
zero, the implementation behaves as though Svadu is not implemented.
